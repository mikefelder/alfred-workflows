Choice workflows I use regularly.

# Alfred Weather 
[jason0x43/alfred-weather](https://github.com/jason0x43/alfred-weather)
An [Alfred][alfred] workflow for showing weather forecasts.


## Setup & Usage
The workflow has one top-level command, `wtr`, and three sub-commands, daily (`wtd`), hourly (`wth`), and options (`wto`). The first thing you'll need to do is configure some options.
