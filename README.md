# alfred-workflows
Choice workflows I use regularly with [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) that utilize the [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).
It's worth every penny.

# Alfred Weather 
[jason0x43/alfred-weather](https://github.com/jason0x43/alfred-weather)
An [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) workflow for showing weather forecasts.


## Setup & Usage
The workflow has one top-level command, `wtr`, and three sub-commands, daily (`wtd`), hourly (`wth`), and options (`wto`). The first thing you'll need to do is configure some options.
